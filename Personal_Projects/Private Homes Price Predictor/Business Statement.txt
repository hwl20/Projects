Business Statement:
- For home seekers/property investors, they seek to be able to buy a home at a lowest possible value. 
- Thus, it is of best interest to have a predictor system that is capable of providing an approximation of home prices according to their general preferences
- This enable buyers to get a rough estimate for a property they are looking for and work a budget out
*Note: If user already has a particular housing development in mind, then simply searching for it will do. Here the aim is to give a general price estimate according to GENERAL parameters like Locale, Area, Floor Level, Freehold Status, New or Resale etc.

Aim: 
Understand the demographics of private home pricing in Singapore, before curating a model to conduct predictive analysis for private home prices


Workflow:
Obtaining Data
Data Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis
Model Building
Model Validation

Background on Data:
- Obtained Private Residental Property Transactions(Type Apartments and Condominiums) data from URA website (https://www.ura.gov.sg/realEstateIIWeb/transaction/search.action)
- New sale & Resale transactions cover all 28 of Singapore Postal Districts, and ranges from July-2016 to July-2021 (Recent 5 years)
- Private property in Singapore can be categorized into 4 sub-categories:
Landed Properties, Strata Landed, Apartments & Condominiums, Executive Condominiums
- In this project we will only be focusing on Apartments & Condominiums, as they are the most common type of private properties and have very high transactions rate (https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/households/households/latest-data)
